# Introduction to Git

This hands-on lab is designed to assess your understanding of the fundamental Git concepts of branching, committing, and merging. You are free to complete this lab using any environment.

## Instructions

To successfully complete this lab, please follow these steps:

1. Create a new branch: Create a branch with your name (e.g., git checkout -b your-name).

2. Make changes and commit: Make a change to any file in this repository (or create a new one).  Commit your changes to your branch.

3. Merge your branch: Merge your branch into the main branch.

4. Push your changes: Push your branch to the remote repository.

5. Submit a Pull Request: Submit a Pull Request to merge your branch into the main branch.

## Evaluation

Your submission will be evaluated automatically by a GitHub Action. The action will check the commit history to verify that you have:

- Created a branch (other than the initial default branch of **main**)

- Made at least one commit

- Performed a merge

**Reminder**: Ensure that your commit messages are clear and descriptive.

If the GitHub Action passes, you have successfully completed the assignment! :D
